# Machine-learning
The iris dataset consists of features that are used to predit flower species. We have 3 class(Iris-virginica, Iris-versicolor,Iris-setosa). The classification is based on SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.
We have 3 types of machine learning algorithm
i.e. Supervised, unsupervised and reinforced.
The first part implements Decision tree classifier a supervised machine learning algorithm.
The model is created using Decision tree classifier.
Some visualizations are done to draw insights from the data
